## What is Courtship?

Courtship is an app designed to help connect high school basketball players with college coaches. Players who want to continue their basetkball careers in college want to be able to build a profile to share with college coaches and demonstrate their interests. College coaches want to be able to search for recruits, build a relationship with them, and have a watchlist of talent to communicate with staff. This app, Courtship, will be the bridge between these two users and aid both high school basketball players and college coaches with the recruitment process.

## The Appsmith App

Our appsmith app features four pages that allows:
- A PUT method for Players to update their personal information
- A POST method for Scouts to submit their Scouting Reports
- A GET method for Players to search a college's statistics
- A DELETE method to delete certain colleges from a roster

## Developers

The AppSmith was developed by Derek Joyce and Stephanie Yee. To limit the number of times it needed to be uploaded to Git and for ease of coordination, we worked together on the same laptop and uploaded all at once at the end.
